Abigail writes:

How could the novels of Charles Dickens shape nineteenth-century reading communities? This paper traces Dickens's resonance through the archival records left behind by Mutual Improvement Societies, a vibrant form of neighborhood reading and discussion clubs especially popular among low-to-middle-income adult learners in Victorian Britain. Bridging research and pedagogy, Droge's engagement with the experiences of nineteenth-century readers in turn prompts reflection on the potential that Dickens's novels can have in our own twenty-first-century classrooms and communities, as well. 

[Abigail Droge](https://abigaildroge.com/about/)'s research and teaching both emphasize how literature can help us to build interdisciplinary learning communities. After receiving her PhD from the Stanford English Department, where her dissertation focused on nineteenth-century British literature and the history of reading, she worked at the University of California, Santa Barbara as a Postdoctoral Scholar for a collaborative Mellon-funded digital and public humanities project called “WhatEvery1Says: The Humanities in Public Discourse” (WE1S).  She then taught in the English Department at Emory University as an ACLS Emerging Voices Fellow. Currently, she teaches at Purdue University in the Cornerstone Integrated Liberal Arts Program, a humanities-based general education sequence geared towards science and engineering students.

We look forward to welcoming you to our virtual discussion of Abigial's work! Please contact [Kate Thomas](https://www.brynmawr.edu/inside/people/kate-thomas) for the paper and meeting link.
