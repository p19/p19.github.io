Sara writes:

This paper will focus on the fin-de-siècle poet Graham R. Tomson (later known as Rosamund Marriott Watson). I will consider Tomson as a female aesthete who used her public image to reinforce her poetic identity, linking this to her philosophical conceptions of beauty and art. My paper analyses portraits of Tomson, including a newly discovered photograph, linking these images to Tomson's preoccupation with women's portraits in her poetry and art criticism.

Dr. Sarah Parker is Lecturer in English at Loughborough University.  She is the author of *The Lesbian Muse and Poetic Identity, 1889–1930* (Routledge 2015).
