Please join us on Monday, April 22nd at 5.15pm for a discussion of Padma Rangarajan's paper <b>"Strange Revolutions: Shifting the Borders of Romantic Terror."</b>

Please contact Rachel Buurma or Kate Thomas for a copy of the paper.

Padma writes:

In 1794, in a fit of despair, Edmund Burke wrote a letter to a friend expressing his conviction that, “Our Government and our Laws are beset by two different Enemies, which are sapping its foundations, Indianism and Jacobinism. In some Cases they act separately, in some they are in conjunction; But of this I am sure; that the first is the worst by far, and the hardest to deal with…” This paper is about that first and weirdly opaque evil, “Indianism,” and how Burke’s unholy union of Indianism and Jacobinism is a fruitful place to look for the origins of modern terrorism discourse.
