P19 is a cross-institutional, interdisciplinary, nineteenth-century literature and culture seminar convened by Rachel Sagner Buurma (Swarthmore), Talissa Ford (Temple), Mary Mullen (Villanova), Kate Thomas (Bryn Mawr), Alisha Walters (Penn State Abington), and Elizabeth Coggin Womack (Penn State Brandywine), and attended by students and scholars from across the Philadelphia region (and now, in our virtual phase, across the globe). We are funded by Temple University's Center for the Humanities (CHAT) and a TriCo Mellon Faculty Forum grant from Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore Colleges. We invite you to join us!
